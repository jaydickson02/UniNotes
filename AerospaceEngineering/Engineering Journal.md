# Areas of focus

- Currently looking at refining and expaning my knowledge of ai models, differential equations and orbital mechanics.
    - Reading through the book Fundamentals of Astrodynamics.
    - Generating vector field simulations for differential equations
    - Writing a 2 dimensional GA and NN based Satellite avoidence system in p5.js

- Investigating the use of a Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- Considering whether or not its simpler to model each orbit as a plane so that the software is only considering a 2D subset.
    - Would need to workout how to incorporate overlaps.
