# The Design Process

- Starts with a customer need
    - Request for proposal (RFP)
    - Brief
- Define the requirments
    - This is a two way process between the designer and the customer
    - Allows for a generation of a product requirments document (PRD)
        - Making the product to this ensures you have met your legal needs
- Generate Ideas
- Evaluate the ideas
    - Core of engineering
- Decide
- Restart the loop from idea generation
    -   This could be done twice
    -   Allows us to make sure we have the best solution
- Final design definition
    - End with a complient product

# Requirments

- All products have a function or functions:
    - To provide thrust
    - To illuminate
    - To fly
    - To manipulate
- All products have attributes
    - Mass
    - Size
    - Cost
    - Marketability
    - Operating Costs
    - Service Lifetime
    - Aesthetic Appeal

## Defining Requirments

- The Requirments definition process takes the customer's needs and translateds them into product requirments
- Requirmenrts state what is required of the component, system or process **not** how it should be designed.

- Requirments should be defined as fully as possible before attempting to devise solutions. Not always possible.

## Atributes
-   Some attributes are directly related to the products functions
    - For example, a *Turbofan Engine* has the following function-rekated attributes:
        - Thrust
        - Reverse Thrust
